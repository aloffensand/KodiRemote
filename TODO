Find out which shortcuts have what string (multimedia keys?)
It would be nice to have a "stop library scan" instead of that warning …
Skip intro: while watching a series, you can say how long the intro is (or
    press "intro started" and "intro stopped" while watching an episode). Then
    you can press a button when the intro starts to jump that far ahead.
ProgressBar: Make triangle splittable

Bugs:
Pressing Return in the sendTextTextBox calls selectAction instead of accepting
    the input. Pressing Menu does the same thing, most other keys work.
When I switch off my wifi device, I get a
    "Method "GetAll" with signature "s" on interface
    "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties" doesn't exist".
    I don't want any feedback besides "connection lost"…
    The error seems to show up AFTER curl.send(data);
    curl.onreadystatechange doesn't seem to get called anymore.
    Strangely, building a try-catch around curl.onreadystatechange or curl.send
    doesn't solve the problem though. Several other try-catches do nothing,
too…
When I cap the connection via kNetworkManager's Disable Wireless, it doesn't
    show "connection lost". If I open the remote AFTER disabling wireless, it
    works as expected. 
    Update: Fixed?
