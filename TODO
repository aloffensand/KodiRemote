Use jsonRPC's notifications instead of polling for information
Items grow out of the visible area when the mainTab gets too small
connectionBox and messageBox overlap with items
Commandline options?

Add multimedia keys for player controls and enter for select
    Apparently, you cannot define several shortcuts for one action …
    I could say that everything has two shortcuts, then I'd just need to create
    another action that has the same function and a different shortcut.
It would be nice to have a "stop library scan" instead of that warning …
Use jsonrpc notifications instead of actively asking for everything
Skip intro: while watching a series, you can say how long the intro is (or
    press "intro started" and "intro stopped" while watching an episode). Then
    you can press a button when the intro starts to jump that far ahead.
Progress bar: use a progress bar with a triangle over/under it to skip through
    a video. When moving the triangle, it shows the editable time where you
    would jump. Jump by pressing a button. Make that triangle splittable to
    repeat a scene.

Bugs:
When I switch off my wifi device, I get a
    "Method "GetAll" with signature "s" on interface
    "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties" doesn't exist".
    I don't want any feedback besides "connection lost"…
    The error seems to show up AFTER curl.send(data);
    curl.onreadystatechange doesn't seem to get called anymore.
    Strangely, building a try-catch around curl.onreadystatechange or curl.send
    doesn't solve the problem though. Several other try-catches do nothing,
too…

When I cap the connection via kNetworkManager's Disable Wireless, it doesn't
    show "connection lost". If I open the remote AFTER disabling wireless, it
    works as expected. 
    Update: Fixed?
