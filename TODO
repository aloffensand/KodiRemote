Known bugs:
    Audio changes tune when you jump (probably Kodi bug)
    Many keys don't work for shortcuts, like the keypad arrows and multimedia keys
    Audio and Subtitles don't always change to the defaults (possibly fixed)

    Network:
    When I switch off my wifi device, I get a
        "Method "GetAll" with signature "s" on interface
        "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties" doesn't exist".
        I don't want any feedback besides "connection lost"…
        The error seems to show up AFTER curl.send(data);
        curl.onreadystatechange doesn't seem to get called anymore.
        Strangely, building a try-catch around curl.onreadystatechange or curl.send
        doesn't solve the problem though. Several other try-catches do nothing,
    too…
    When the connection is capped via kNetworkManager's Disable Wireless, it doesn't
        show "connection lost". If I open the remote AFTER disabling wireless, it
        works as expected. 
        Update: Fixed?


Add functionality to VideoTab?
Add MusicTab
Test if a Video player can "play" images or music.
  If not, change the "Add url to playlist" functionality

Rewrite much of MainTab/PlayerControls:
 - Maybe add static ids for polling requests like player properties,
   other "requests" get an id of [index] + 30 or something like that.

Add a timer for sendUrl: if no player is started 5 seconds later, give a
warning / an error.

Make a Timer for requests: If it isn't received in a set amount of time even
    though it's supposed to be connected, delete the request (or resend it?)
    and log that there's a connection issue. Perhaps even try reconnecting.
    I might also give static ids to all requests (e.g. getvolume always has id=0)

Update Shortcuts
Find out which shortcuts have what string (multimedia keys?)
Volume slider: usable with arrows
Playback speed control
Default audio & subtitles: More options
Commandline options?

It would be nice to have a "stop library scan" instead of that warning …
Skip intro: while watching a series, you can say how long the intro is (or
    press "intro started" and "intro stopped" while watching an episode). Then
    you can press a button when the intro starts to jump that far ahead.
ProgressBar: Make triangle splittable

Visuals:
    Items grow out of the visible area when the mainTab gets too small
    connectionBox and messageBox overlap with items
    Fix fixed colours (notification background etc)
    ProgressBar: Change colours if disabled
