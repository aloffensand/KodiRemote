Use jsonRPC's notifications instead of polling for information
Items grow out of the visible area when the mainTab gets too small
connectionBox and messageBox overlap with items
Commandline options?

Find out which shortcuts have what string (multimedia keys?)
It would be nice to have a "stop library scan" instead of that warning …
Skip intro: while watching a series, you can say how long the intro is (or
    press "intro started" and "intro stopped" while watching an episode). Then
    you can press a button when the intro starts to jump that far ahead.
ProgressBar: Make triangle splittable
Settings for videos (kodi does not always start a video with the selected
    settings, especially regarding subtitles. It would be nice if the remote
    could do so instead [settings the subtitles to "eng"/"english" if possible
    and than restarting the video to ensure they are shown from the start]
Fix fixed colours (notification background etc)
In SettingsTab, show which Tab is currently active

Bugs:
When I switch off my wifi device, I get a
    "Method "GetAll" with signature "s" on interface
    "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties" doesn't exist".
    I don't want any feedback besides "connection lost"…
    The error seems to show up AFTER curl.send(data);
    curl.onreadystatechange doesn't seem to get called anymore.
    Strangely, building a try-catch around curl.onreadystatechange or curl.send
    doesn't solve the problem though. Several other try-catches do nothing,
too…
When I cap the connection via kNetworkManager's Disable Wireless, it doesn't
    show "connection lost". If I open the remote AFTER disabling wireless, it
    works as expected. 
    Update: Fixed?
