	* PlayerControls.qml, GeneralControls.qml, ChoosePlayerRow.qml, MainTab.qml:
	Fixed sizes of the MainTab's children so the controls don't overlap when the
	window is too small; Instead, they now grow out of the window â€¦

	* Triangle.qml, PlayerControls.qml (progressRow): Changed the
	progressSlider to a ProgressBar with a MouseArea underneath (will implement
	the possibility to loop in a video later).

	focused tab is underlined.

	* main.qml (frame): The root element is now a Window.

	* main.cpp: Added a c++ file from which QML is called.

	* PlayerControls.qml, MainTab.qml, ChoosePlayerRow.qml: Merged a few setter
	functions and the updateTimers so there are fewer requests.

	* main.qml (shortcuts, shortcut_*): Shortcuts are seperate strings instead
	of a dict so they can be changed in the config file.

	* main.qml (getResponse, expectedError): Bugfix (somewhat): When a video
	ends, it doesn't throw a dozen errors anymore. However, it now doesn't
	print these messages at all.
