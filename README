Compilation:
  qmake
  make clean && make
Installation:
  make install

By default, the program will be installed to /usr/local, this can be changed by
calling qmake with a PREFIX variable:
  qmake PREFIX=<install_path>

The executable is put into PREFIX/bin and its
desktop file into PREFIX/share/applications.

If you wish to install the program in your home folder, use something like
  qmake PREFIX=~/.local
or
  qmake PREFIX=~/
instead of qmake. Just make sure the chosen location in in your $PATH.

Or you can simply copy KodiRemote wherever you want.
